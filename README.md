# Titanic

The project consisted of building a machine learning model to predict
what sort of people were likely to survive the Titanic tragedy. The
process required visualisation of key data sets like gender, age, ticket
class, survival, siblings, parents and spouse. To clean null data in the
age category, the missing information was filled with the mean age
for each gender. The logistic regression classifier model was used
and its performance assessed. It could be seen that the accuracy of
the trained model was (80.4%), sensitivity (85.3%) and specificity
(71.4%).
